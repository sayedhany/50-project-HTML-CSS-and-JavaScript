### Animated Navigation
The code represents a hamburger menu for a website. When the user clicks on the toggle button, it toggles the "active" class on and off of the navigation bar element. This class changes the style of the navigation bar allowing it to slide in and out of view as needed. The code does this by first obtaining a reference to both the toggle button and navigation element using their respective element ids and query selectors. Then an event listener is attached to the toggle button that listens for a click event. Finally, when the toggle button is clicked, it calls the toggle() method on the navigation bar's classList property. The toggle() method switches the active class on or off, depending on whether it is already present or not.
