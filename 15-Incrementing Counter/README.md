### 15-Incrementing Counter

This code selects all the elements on a webpage with the class "counter" using document.querySelectorAll(".counter"); and assigns them in an array-like object called counters.

Then, counters.forEach() is used to loop through each of these elements. counter.innerText = "0"; sets the initial text content of each element, identified by the variable counter, to "0".

A function called updateCounter() is defined inside the forEach() loop. It retrieves the data-target attribute from each counter, converts it to a number type, and assigns it to the target variable. c variable tracks the current value of the counter.

An increment is computed as target / 1000 and added to the current count in every iteration until the target value is reached. If c is less than target, counter.innerText is updated to reflect the difference between the original position of the counter and the new one incremented by increment. Then setTimeout(updateCounter, 1); is called to wait for 1 millisecond before running the updateCounter() function again.

Finally, when c equals or exceeds target, the else statement is triggered and the text content is set to target.

Overall, this code snippet results in a counter animation that starts at 0 and increments towards the data-target value in a smooth animation.
