### Button Ripple Effect

This code adds a ripple effect to a button on a webpage when it is clicked.

```
const btn = document.querySelector(".ripple");
```

This line assigns the DOM element with class "ripple" to the btn variable.

```
const html = document.querySelector("html");
```

This line assigns the html tag of the webpage to the html variable.

```
btn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  //code block
});
```

This code block adds an event listener for the click event to the btn element. When the button is clicked, the code inside the block will execute.

```
console.log(e);
```
This line logs the e object (the event object) to the console.

```
const x = e.pageX;
const y = e.pageY;
```

These lines get the x and y coordinates of where the mouse was clicked.

```
const buttonTop = e.target.offsetTop;
const buttonLeft = e.target.offsetLeft;
```

These lines get the position of the button relative to its parent element.

```
const xInside = x - buttonLeft;
const yInside = y - buttonTop;
```

These lines calculate the position of the click inside the button element.

```
const circle = document.createElement("span");
circle.classList.add("circle");
circle.style.top = yInside + "px";
circle.style.left = xInside + "px";
```

These lines create a new span element with a class circle, set its position to the calculated position of the click, and add it as a child element to the btn element.

```
btn.appendChild(circle);
setTimeout(() => circle.remove(), 500);
```

These lines add the circle element to the btn element, and then remove it after half a second (500 milliseconds).

```
html.classList.toggle("toggle");
```

This line toggles the toggle class on the html element, which could be used to trigger some CSS animations or effects.
