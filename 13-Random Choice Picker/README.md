### Random Choice Picker
- This JavaScript code is used to create a simple web app that allows the user to enter a list of tags separated by commas into a textarea element, and then select one or more of them at random.

The first two lines declare two variables tagsEl and textarea by using document.getElementById() method to retrieve elements from the HTML page's DOM (Document Object Model). The textarea.focus() method ensures that the cursor is automatically placed in the textarea when the page loads.

The next few lines of code add an event listener to the textarea with "keyup" event. This will call the createTags function whenever the user types anything in the textarea. If the key pressed is "Enter", it clears the textarea input field and calls the randomSelect function.

The createTags function accepts the value entered in the textarea as input. It splits the input string based on comma (,) delimiter, filters out any unwanted spaces using .filter() method and maps each tag with .map() method after trimming it. Then it updates the content of tagsEl element which initially is empty using innerHTML property. It creates a span tag for each tag and adds a class tag and text to it before appending it to the tagsEl.

The randomSelect function uses setInterval() method to repeatedly highlight and unhighlight a random tag from the list of tags displayed using pickRandomTag() function. The pickRandomTag function randomly selects a tag from .tag class. Once 30 intervals are done it clears the interval using clearInterval(interval) method.

The last two functions highlightTag and unHighlightTag are helper functions that add and remove class highlight respectively, to create a visual effect when a tag is randomly selected.

Overall, this Javascript code creates an interactive and entertaining UI where users can generate and randomly select tags.
