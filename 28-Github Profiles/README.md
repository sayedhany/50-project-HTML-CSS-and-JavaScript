### Github Profiles

This code is a JavaScript program that fetches data about a GitHub user and displays it on an HTML webpage.

The first three lines declare constants `APIURL`, `main`, `form`, and `search` using the `const` keyword. `APIURL` is a string that represents the URL of the GitHub API endpoint to be used for fetching user information. `main`, `form`, and `search` are DOM elements, identified by their respective `id` attributes.

The next line declares a variable `user` using the `let` keyword.

The next function, `getUser(username)`, is an asynchronous function declared using the `async` keyword. It takes in a `username` parameter, which will be concatenated with `APIURL` to fetch information about the specified GitHub user from the API. The function uses the `try-catch` block to handle errors in case there is no such user found. If the API call is successful, `createUserCard(data)` and `getRepos(username)` functions will be called with the fetched data.

The `getRepos(username)` function is another asynchronous function declared using the `async` keyword. This function fetches repository data about the specified GitHub user using the same API endpoint. It also uses the `try-catch` block to handle errors such as when repositories for the specified user cannot be found.

The `createUserCard(user)` function takes in a `user` object and generates the HTML card containing information about the GitHub user. If the user has a `name`, it is used as the `userID`. Otherwise, the `login` name will be used. A condition checks if the `bio` exists, and if so, adds it to the card. The function then adds the `avatar_url`, `followers`, `following`, `public_repos`, and "remove" button to the card. When `createUserCard(user)` is called, it overwrites the `innerHTML` of the `main` element with the generated card HTML. It also adds an event listener to listen for a `click` event and remove the card if the button is clicked.

The `createErrorCard(msg)` function generates an error card HTML when called with an input `msg`. When called, it overwrites the `innerHTML` of the `main` element with the generated HTML.

The `addReposToCard(repos)` function takes in an array of repository data about a GitHub user and generates an HTML list containing at most five repositories. Each repository item links to the corresponding repository on GitHub by setting its `href` attribute to the HTML URL of the repository. When called, `addReposToCard(repos)` appends the generated HTML to the `repos` element within the previously created card.

The last part of the program registers an event listener on the form element. When a form submission event is triggered, the `getUser()` function will be called, passing in the value entered as the input field's value, after which the value of the input field will be cleared.
