The given code is for a simple image gallery functionality which involves selecting an image by clicking on the corresponding button displaying below the image.

1. `const imgs = document.querySelectorAll(".content");`
   This line of code selects all the HTML elements with a class name of "content" and stores them as an array in the variable named imgs.

2. `const btns = document.querySelectorAll("li");`
   This line of code selects all the html list items and stores them in the variable named btns.

3. `btns.forEach((btn, idx) => {...});`
   The forEach() method loops through all the items in the btns array and adds a click event listener to each of them. The second parameter 'idx' represents the index number of the current item.

4. `btn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {...});`
   This line of code listens for a click event on each button and performs the following steps when a button is clicked.

5. `btns.forEach((btn1) => {...});`
   This forEach() loop removes the active class from all buttons present in the btns array.

6. `btn.classList.add("active");`
   This step adds the active class to the button that was clicked.

7. `console.log(idx);`
   This logs the index number of the currently clicked button to the console.

8. `imgs.forEach((img) => {...});`
   This forEach() loop removes an existing show class from all images selected in the imgs array.

9. `imgs[idx].classList.add("show");`
   Finally, this line of code adds the show class to the image corresponding to the button that was clicked by using its index number. This makes the image visible in the gallery.

In summary, when a button is clicked, the code will add the active class to the clicked button, remove any existing active classes from the other buttons, remove existing show classes from all images, and then add a show class to the image corresponding to the clicked button.
