This code selects all elements with class "code" using `querySelectorAll()` and stores them in an array called `codes`. It then sets the focus on the first element of `codes` array using `focus()`. 

Then a `forEach()` loop is used to iterate through each element of `codes` array. For each element, it adds a "keydown" event listener. When a keydown event occurs, the function inside the event listener checks if the pressed key is a number (0 to 9) by checking key codes using comparison operators. 

If the pressed key is a number, the value attribute of the current `code` is set to an empty string using `.value = ""`, and then the next element in the `codes` array after the current index `idx` is focused using `setTimeout(() => codes[idx + 1].focus(), 10)` with a 10 milliseconds delay.

If the pressed key is the backspace key, `setTimeout(() => codes[idx - 1].focus(), 10)` is called which focuses the previous element in the `codes` array after the current index `-1` with a 10 milliseconds delay. 

Overall, this code creates an input field where only numbers can be entered, and when a number is entered, focus is automatically shifted to the next input field in the sequence, making data entry easier.
