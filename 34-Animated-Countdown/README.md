### Animated-Countdown

This JavaScript code defines a number counter animation that runs count-up and count-down animations for a specific set of numbers.

- The first four lines declare constants `nums`, `counter`, `finalMessage`, and `replay`. These constants retrieve references to specific HTML elements in the document using their class and ID selectors.
- The next two lines call functions `runAnimation()` which attaches an event listener to each number element in the `nums` array, such that when an animation ends, it will either trigger the next animation or display the final message.
- The `resetDOM()` function resets the state of the HTML classes for each number and removes the 'hide' and 'show' classes from the `counter` and `finalMessage` elements respectively.
- The `runAnimation()` function sets up event listeners for each number element, listens for the end of each animation, and responds by modifying classes on the number elements and other elements on the page.
- Finally, an event listener is attached to the `replay` button, such that when it is clicked, both `resetDOM()` and `runAnimation()` functions are called.

This code likely creates a countdown or count-up animation with numbered circles that appears on a webpage. When the animation completes (either going up to a certain number or back down to zero), a "final" message is displayed, and the "replay" button allows user to start over.
