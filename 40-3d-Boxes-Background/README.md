### 3d-Boxes-Background

- Live view: https://50-project-html-css-js-chatgpt.netlify.app/40-3d-Boxes-Background

This code defines a JavaScript program that manipulates the CSS styles on a webpage to create and adjust a grid of boxes.

The first two lines define two constants, `boxesContainer` and `btn`, each of which is assigned the value of an element from the HTML document using `document.getElementById()`. Specifically, `boxesContainer` is assigned the element with the ID `"boxes"` and `btn` is assigned the element with the ID `"btn"`.

The third line adds an event listener to the button specified by `btn`. When the button is clicked, the function within the arrow function expression will be called. The function toggles the class of the `boxesContainer` element between `"big"` and not having the class `"big"`.

The fourth section of code defines a function named `createBoxes()` that creates a 4x4 grid of individual boxes, each with a class of `"box"`. The nested `for` loops in this function generate the boxes and their CSS styles by creating them via `document.createElement("div")`, setting their positions using `box.style.backgroundPosition = `${-j _ 125}px ${-i _ 125}px`;`, and appending them to the `boxesContainer` element.

Finally, the `createBoxes()` function is called so that the boxes are rendered on the page when the script runs.
